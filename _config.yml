       Hello! I am Yousif, a mechanical engineer at heart with a passion for robotics. My master's thesis at the Robotics Research Lab focused on leveraging
       Unreal Engine to train autonomous RL policies using different modalities and reward formulations, with a consideration of framework reusability 
       [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/YoElsheikh/ms-thesis-rrlab/tree/master). I am currently a research associate at the Insitute of Airract Systems (ILS).
       My interests include Cyber Physical Systems, Control Theory, 3D Computer Vision, Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I like coffee, but not because it tastes good.

          Migration from YOLOv3 + Keras runtime to YOLOv7 + ONNX runtime, modifying the pipeline for better performance. Training and detailed evaluation
          and comparison between the 2 pipelines. Deployment.
          *Accomplishments*: Labeled Training data, trained YOLOv7 and carried out a detailed evaluation to consolidate the increase of performance
          (accuracy, precision & recall) beteween the old and new pipeline. The tool is live as of 28.08.2023.

          Proof of Concept and Know-How using Stereo-vision generated data and Deep Learning to position and classify objects 
          for a logistic-arm manipulator. Dataset generation, labeling and best approach investigation.
          *Accomplishments*: Applied and modified 2 state-of-the-art 3D CV class algorithms, one that consumes pointclouds directly 
          as well as techniques that are based on 2D CV and leverages pointclouds to estimate the position.

          minimize the cost function of the LQR to stabalize the non-linear IPS.
          *Accomplishments*: Successfully applied the controller and carried out a comparison against fine-tuned LQR considering the performance and energy
          consumption.
